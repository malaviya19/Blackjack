   Blackjack starts with players making bets.

   Dealer deals 2 cards to the players and two to himself
   (1 card face up, the other face down).

   Players must decide whether to stand, hit, surrender, double 
   down, or split.

   The dealer acts last and must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 through 21.

   Players win when their hand totals higher than dealerâ€™s hand, or they
   have 21 or less when the dealer busts (i.e., exceeds 21).

        Card values: 

   All cards count their face value in blackjack. Picture 
   cards count as 10 and the ace can count as either 1 or 
   11. Card suits have no meaning. The total of any hand is 
   the sum of the card values in the hand Players must decide 
   whether to stand, hit, surrender, double down, or sp
